The Bit Shift Assembler for the 6502 / 65C02 / 45GS02 CPU.

The Assembler supports the address modes and instructions of the
45GS02 CPU as used in the MEGA65 computer.

Instructions how to use the assembler are contained in the first pages
of the assembler source "bsa.c".

A full documentation will be added later.

A cross-assembler for hosts running MAC OSX, Linux or Windows

The executable file "bsa_m1.x" in this repository is compiled for MACs with M1 CPU.

Windows and Linux users have to download the source code "bsa.c"
and compile it with a standard C compiler. gcc for Linux
or Visual C for Windows should do the job.

The bsa assembler is a command line program.
There is no GUI.
